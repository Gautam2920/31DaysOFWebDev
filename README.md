## 🧠 About the Challenge

> *"Consistency creates progress — one commit at a time."*

I’m starting #31DaysOfWebDev to overcome the underconfidence I often feel while working with web development.
Even though I already have some experience with frontend and its frameworks, I want to rebuild my foundation , one day at a time.

This challenge is my way to commit, log, and document my daily learning journey, moving from the absolute basics to advanced concepts and eventually, to building complete real-world projects.

It’s not just about mastering web dev , it’s about building consistency, confidence, and creative momentum.
